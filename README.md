# 3D-Graphics-Engine

<p> This is a basic 3D graphics engine built with the help of the olcPixelGameEngine by OneLoneCoder found here: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine</p>

<p> Big thanks to him for this learning tools, tutorials, and resources </p>

<p> The olcPixelGameEngine helps display pixels on a terminal but the 3D graphics and matrix multiplication are all done in separate files and not built into the engine </p>

<p> to be continued </p>
